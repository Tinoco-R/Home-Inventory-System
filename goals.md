# Goals
- Build a home inventory system
    - Can be utilized by members of a household to better help identify items that are running low in quantity to purchase
        - For such items, find the cheapest item across a set of stores
        - Can either select a set of stores near the household (zip-code) or within a specified range [provide options for the user]
    - System to be able to be accessed from mobile and pc devices

- Work using SDLC practices
    - Determine which SDLC model to follow
        -  Gather further research on the domain
            - Project will involve either the creation of an application (either web app or desktop/mobile app)
            - Project will need to work with a database real time (especially if multiple users are utilizing it)

- Document all steps of the process and update readme as work progresses
    - Can later be referenced to show reasoning for choices
    - Useful for visitors by providing deeper contexts

- Emphasis will be done on automated testings
    - Goal to have over 80% line coverage
    - Continuous Integration is also another goal (figure out how to implement)

- Coding practices
    - Aim to apply best coding practices (asserts, exception handling, logging, etc.)
